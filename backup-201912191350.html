So much can happen in the span of a decade. Sports dynasties falter. Dialects evolve. Innovations proliferate. Subcultures are birthed and killed.

Sneaker culture has grown in leaps and bounds in the last decade. Social media has shifted communities from IRL to URL. Sneakers and couture have become inseparably intertwined. Exclusivity has become synonymous with cultural credibility. Celebrity endorsements have become a marketing device. Sneakers are a bigger business than ever before.

These pivotal shifts in the sneaker world have defined and shaped the last decade.

        <p class="hero-shoe-copy">Premium leather, $400 price tag, no embellishments aside from subtle numeric text in gold, this is not everyone’s idea of a tennis shoe. The Common Projects Achilles sneaker was first launched in three colorways (white, grey and black) by founders Peter Poopat and Flavio Girolami, and was quickly canonised into a status symbol by the menswear set. The Achilles eventually became one of the most imitated sneakers of the following years, spawning numerous minimalist footwear brands who also used the Margom cup sole that Common Projects made famous.</p>

This early “Cove” colorway was inspired by the clear waters off the Bahamian coast, as Fieg experimented with a vivid, tonal colorway that was released in only 300 pairs.</p>

The LeBron 8 “South Beach” inarguably took King James’ signature line to another level of popularity.</p>

It’s tough to miss the similarities between Alife’s Everybody High sneaker and another seminal skateboarding model produced by the brand with the Swoosh, but with this, Alife continued a strong tradition of independent skate and streetwear brands bootlegging the bigger guys.</p>

Initially known for his eye for color-blocking models like the ASICS GEL-Lyte 3 when designing the 252 pack for retailer David Z, Fieg later established his ability for re-invigorating underdog brands and products that others may have overlooked, like Sebago boat shoes and Red Wing boots.<p></p>The first Kith stores opened in 2011, and the shop’s in-house cut-and-sew collections slowly matured season after season. Featuring a snug ankle cuff and roomy cargo pockets, the Mercer pant further helped put Kith and Fieg on the map.<p></p>Since then, the Kith brand has become known for its clean, Daniel Arsham-designed interiors; the Kith Treats sub-brand of ice cream; and playful pop culture collaborations with the likes of Disney, Sprite, and Cap’n Crunch.</p>

          <p>In 2012, Nike arrived at the London 2012 Summer Olympics with something new that would go on to define research and development for many footwear brands in following years. This innovation was Flyknit, a textile that was subsequently and widely imitated by competitors, including adidas Primeknit, PUMA evoKNIT, Reebok Ultraknit, and many more.<p></p>“Volt”-colored Nike Flyknit footwear was effortlessly discernible on the feet of athletes like Mo Farah who donned eye-catching neon track spikes that made headlines the world over. In addition to the performance track footwear, Nike Flyknit Trainers and Flyknit Racer sneakers were given to athletes to wear on the podium and during the opening ceremony.<p></p>The shoes were gifted to Nike athletes, also done up in Nike’s signature “Volt” colorway, featuring “USA” stitched into the tongue. In addition to standing out on television screens across the world, these new Flyknit shoes were far lighter, and offered a new set of performance qualities unparalleled by shoes with traditional leather uppers.<p></p>“Flyknit was a paradigm shift. It changed the way performance footwear was designed, produced, and worn. For the first time since the beginning of mass production, it offered an alternative to the cutting, sewing, stitching and gluing that constrained the design, manufacture and fit of shoes. Not only has it allowed for the creation of one of the lightest, most form-fitting performance shoes ever, but it is also a manufacturing technique that virtually eliminates waste.”<p></p>-Tony Bignell, VP of Footwear Innovation, Nike</p>

Fox in the film was designed wit the help of Tinker Hatfield, and Nike later worked on making this auto-lacing technology more than just a special effect. The Nike MAG was then produced in 1500 pairs in 2011, and auctioned with net proceeds going directly to The Michael J. Fox Foundation. This special piece of movie memorabilia and highly collectible sneaker is still considered one of the all-time sneaker grails, and will be for years to come. Yet another Nike MAG release came in 2016, which dropped in 89 pairs featuring Nike’s “adaptive fit,” which senses the wearer and tightens or loosens fit accordingly.</p>

          <p>While LeBron James’ signature footwear line has now reached its 17th iteration, it was the LeBron 9 that struck a core with sneakerheads more than any other of his signature models. Maybe it’s due to the fact that LeBron took home his first title while wearing the 9, or maybe it’s because the shoe is packed with tech like Zoom Air, Max Air, Flywire, Pro Combat and even fiberglass, but for many collectors, LeBron’s signature line is all about the 9.</p>

          <p>This special Jordan 5 was released to celebrate the Jordan Tokyo 23 store in Japan. This highly limited-edition model features an inverted 23 insignia on the heel, with a yellow suede upper, and is regarded not only as one of the most collectible Jordans of the decade, but also one of the most expensive. Although the Jordan 5 T23 used a formula that now seems simple – create a limited colorway and drop it as a local exclusive – this kind of marketing-driven thinking was something that brands were only starting to become familiar with in 2011.</p>

The Free Run 2 underpinned a later thread of lightweight, minimalist sneaker designs that continued throughout the rest of the decade. While the Free Run 2 was widely available from running stores around the world, Nike also issued up a number of limited versions which caught the eye of sneakerheads, including a Doernbecher version, premium leather Tier Zero versions, and locally exclusive “City Pack” releases. For some, the Free Run 2 remained a favorite long after later Free Run iterations hit the market.</p>

          <p>Around 2014, it seemed like every streetwear and fashion brand under the rainbow was making their own version of the tapered sweatpants with a ribbed ankle, which Publish Brand claims to have invented (they even trademarked the term “The Jogger Pant”). The jogger style took over from the practice of pin-rolling, which was a way to avoid your pants taking any shine from your sneakers – in short, emphasizing your kicks above any other article of your outfit.<p></p>On the high-end, Balmain’s biker-inspired track pants had a huge moment, while Nike’s tech-fleece style proved to be hugely commercially successful. The cuffed jogger style eventually even trickled down to fast fashion stores like Zara and H&M.</p>

          <p>Raf Simons’ re-design of the adidas Ozweego marked the dawn of a massive shift in sneaker tastes. While the original Ozweego was introduced in 1996, and updated iterations were released throughout the 1990s, the silhouette gained an entirely new cultural relevance years later in 2013.<p></p>Initially, publications (including us at Highsnobiety) were at a loss for words when trying to characterize the shoes, and a new set of descriptors emerged – “chunky,” “bulky,” et al. While those first individuals to embrace the Raf Ozweego were the source of mockery from those who considered themselves sneaker purists, the Ozweego eventually catalyzed exaggerated proportions and exaggerated shapers becoming commonplace, a trend that arguably peaked with the Balenciaga Triple S.</p>

Those that spotted the neon sneakers on their TV screens had to wait months before the Flyknit Trainer and Flyknit Racer actually hit shelves. The sneaker was a fulfilment of Nike’s steadfast commitment to innovation, while later HTM versions like the Nike Lunar Flyknit HTM NRG established the Flyknit franchise a leader in technology and fashion.</p>

The first generation Mars Yard used NASA tech like Vectran, a robust and slightly shimmery material with high tensile strength that is used for NASA space suits. An SFB sole unit served as the foundation of the simple low-top, while details like red pull-tabs and exposed foam for the tongue gave this shoe a distinctly workshopp-appropriate feel. The 2017 re-issue served up a second opportunity for collectors to get their hands on a pair.</p>

It’s unlikely that anyone at adidas saw this coming.<p></p>As far as the bigger picture, Boost hit stores just before the wellness trend took off, running crews became cool, and athleisure had a name. The Ultra Boost went on to become a tour de force, as general-release triple-white and triple-black versions routinely flew off shelves, while collaborations kept sneakerheads paying attention, release after release. More of a flash in the pan looking back, the NMD also helped establish Boost as a leading technology.</p>

        <p class="hero-shoe-copy">The adidas Ozweego was largely a forgotten relic from the mid-90s before Raf Simons got his hands on it. Simons took the shoe and exaggerated the proportions to almost-comic effect, adding sci-fi-looking translucent nodes to the shoe’s upper, which was placed on a de-coupled sole unit. While early-adopters of the shoes were initially mocked, the Raf Simons Ozweego took a huge risk, but its success in fashion circles catalyzed footwear designs to become chunkier and more overstated in years to come.</p>

Technical innovations started to be infused with limited-edition releases, and the attention of collectors was suddenly piqued by knitted textiles like adidas Primeknit and Nike Flyknit, as well as cushioning solutions like adidas Boost and Nike React. Sneakerheads started to demand comfortable running shoes, though not to actually go running in.<p></p>As writer Alex Rakestraw wrote for Highsnobiety earlier in the year: “What people wear has only ever gotten less formal. As social conventions relax, the codes that kept us in corsets then neckties then dress shoes have relaxed with them. The logical end of this ‘great relaxing’ is sportswear. Tees. Stretchy pants. Sneakers. Sportswear is the language of what people wear today.”</p>

        <div class="moment-copy">
          <p>The world of capital-F Fashion became increasingly obsessed with sneakers over the course of the last 10 years. Historically, rubber-soled shoes have never been associated with luxury, and thus were never a focus for fashion brands, barring a few exceptions like the Lanvin cap-toe sneaker, the Valentino Rock Runner, or the Prada America’s Cup. Going back to 2013-2014, two releases arguably catalyzed a shift: when Raf Simons re-designed the adidas Ozweego, and when Ricardo Tisci re-interpreted the Nike Air Force 1.<p></p>In the years to follow, sneakers invaded the streets and catwalks of Paris Fashion Week, as luxury brands doubled-down on their sneaker offerings. Nearly every leading fashion house (Dior, Balenciaga, Louis Vuitton, Calvin Klein) subsequently satiated the clear demand for luxury trainers by creating their own original statement sneakers.<p></p>The argument could be made that these became more important status symbols for women than handbags or purses. At the end of 2019, this trend reached its pinnacle, with the announcement of Prada x adidas and Dior x Jordan collaborations, aka Pradidas and Diordan.</p>

Nothing short of a seminal moment. The “Red October” Air Yeezy 2 surprise-dropped just when no one thought they would see the light of day.

Subsequently, all-red colorways trickled out from different brands for years to come, each of them evoking the spirit of Kanye West’s most famous sneaker design ever.</p>

It’s true, adidas did do a fair amount to push this shoe on a marketing level, but boy did it work. You could barely step outside with catching a glimpse of a Stan Smith. Whispers say it’s adidas’ best-selling shoe of all time. Alongside the original white-and-green versions, 2014 ushered in a number of Stan Smith collaborations, the most visible of which was likely Raf Simons’ luxury version, which swapped out the original three-stripe detailing on the upper for subtle perforations spelling “R” for Raf.</p>

Sneakersnstuff released one of the first Primeknit Pure Boosts, individually numbered and made in only 600 pairs. The Energy Boost and Pure Boost made a strong case for performance footwear overlapping into the lifestyle space, which set the scene for the unprecedented popularity of the Ultra Boost shortly after.</p>

In-store releases were shut down by police, once again testifying to the die-hard Foamposite audience.</p>

          <p>For years, the overnight campout was a fixture of sneaker communities around the world. As sneakers were eventually adopted into mainstream culture, these campouts and lineups started to overflow with eager newcomers, in some cases even causing concern for public safety.<p></p>From the outside looking in, sneaker lineups never seemed more dire than they did after the “Galaxy” Nike Foamposite release, which was reported by mainstream news outlets in 2012 as being the cause of riots. Subsequently, retailers could no longer ensure safety at these lineups, and violent situations became increasingly common at queues for limited sneakers and Supreme drops.<p></p>While some retailers steadfastly stood by the in-store, first-come first-served model, others shifted their release strategy to online. For hyped sneakers like those from YEEZY and OFF-WHITE™, raffles became the go-to mechanism for ensuring fairness. Brands like Nike also developed their own apps to help democratize releases for those that live in and outside of big cities.</p>

          <p>StockX (originally founded as Campless) took into consideration the shortcomings of reselling sneakers and created a platform that functions as a marketplace, a middleman to provide authentication checks, and a stock market. StockX did what none of its competitors thought of, creating a record of all past sales, effectively homogenizing prices to create a centralized database and forum for sneaker reselling.<p></p>As a testament to StockX’s disruptive business model, they surpassed eBay in total sneaker transactions in 2017. StockX has also been the recipient of numerous high-profile investments from the likes of Scooter Braun, Jon Buscemi, Eminem, Mark Wahlberg and others. In June 2019, StockX raised $110 million and was valued at $1 billion in another venture round.<p></p>At the same time, reselling platforms like Flight Club, Stadium Goods, GOAT, and others received massive investments from industry leaders like Farfetch, Foot Locker, and others, establishing the sneaker aftermarket as one to keep your eye on.<p></p>“No one could have anticipated the size and scale that StockX has achieved in such a short time. It’s unrealistic for any startup to assume it’s going to be selling billions of dollars worth of sneakers in three years. People want a buying and selling experience that is reliable, safe, easy, and authentic, and StockX is that. We created something in this model that no other platform considered and in doing so, truly revolutionized the industry.”<p></p>-Josh Luber, Co-Founder of StockX</p>

        <p class="hero-shoe-copy">Beloved for its snug fit and cozy on-foot feel, the OG Ultra Boost featured a predominantly black upper with a purple heel counter, but it happened to be the triple-white and triple-black versions that went supernova. A Kanye co-sign helped the white version to sell-out instantly, and while re-stocks flew off shelves for the next 2 years. People loved the black version as well, but after some started using a sharpie pen to ink the white midsole black, effectively creating a DIY triple-black, adidas went ahead and released that one too. Later versions of the Ultra Boost (2.0, 3.0, 4.0) slightly changed the Primeknit pattern used for the upper, while adidas also experimented with cageless and mid-top versions.</p>

The “Turtle Dove” colorway also set the tone for creative colorway names that came with later releases like “Pirate Black” and “Moon Rock. Demand for following 350 releases far outpaced supply, and being the first 350 ever to release, the “Turtle Dove” colorway still remains one of the most collectible and expensive YEEZY models, while the subsequent 350 V2 proved to be even more commercially viable.</p>

          <p>ACRONYM’s unprecedented Air Force 1 design by Errolson Hugh was designed with the brand’s technical, functional ethos in mind. It all started in the brand’s Berlin workshop, after an ACRONYM staff member simply took a pair of scissors to the classic, low-top Air Force 1. A zip-up closure on the final version renders the shoe’s laces obsolete, while a contrasting, dipped heel further separates this limited edition from the standard Air Force 1. The first trio of colorways was an instant hit, and years later the design finally returned in a white-on-white version for the “AF100” pack.</p><p>“It was the first overtly disruptive Nike collaboration. It was the first Nike with additional parts grafted onto it. It was the first Nike collaboration that attempted to alter the functionality of the shoe, not just the aesthetics and the branding. It was our first shoe with Nike and we were just focused on doing the collaboration justice. You can’t get asked to do an Air Force 1 and then be half assed about it. We just wanted bring something unique and legitimate to the conversation. We didn’t think about how people would react at all. We just went for it.”</p>

It was the first time I remember seeing women lined up outside a sneaker shop.”<p></p>-Adam Petrick, PUMA Global Director of Brand and Marketing</p>

Walsh made a custom platform PUMA shoe for Rihanna, which laid the groundwork for the massively successful PUMA x Rhianna partnership. the collaboration brought us a number of Creeper iterations including particularly popular orange camouflage and Gucci-inspired colorways, plus Creeper versions with treaded lug soles.</p>

          <p>The successor to the 350 sneaker which landed in 2015, the V2 was a more streamlined silhouette featuring a contrasting stripe across the upper. Since its first release, the 350 V2 has become the most commercialized YEEZY silhouette, being produced in limited “Reflective” versions that have garnered higher resell prices. In September 2018, West announced the biggest-ever drop of YEEZY sneakers, stating, “On September 21 we’re doing our largest drop ever of the 350 V2 Triple White.” This drop marked a shift in distribution, after which YEEZYs no longer sold out with the snap of a finger, but started to linger on shelves.</p>

          <p>A fulfillment of the seemingly impossible idea of “power-lacing” sneakers as Marty McFly referred to them in Back to the Future 2, auto-lacing sneakers became commercially available for the first time with the HyperAdapt. A built-in motor that is controlled by plus and minus buttons on the midsole can tighten and loosen wires in the forefoot. The HyperAdapt was followed up with a shoe called the BB Adapt, which featured a low-top cut, and utilized Nike’s auto-lacing tech for an on-court performance sneaker. While the shoe may seem like the realization of an idea that was ongoing over several decades, the HyperAdapt is merely the beginning for Nike.</p><p>“I wear [the HyperAdapt] a lot, and I wear them partly because they’re comfortable and versatile, but I’m trying to learn about them myself. I wear them a lot because I’m trying to think about the future, and what I would do to change it, make it better. That’s part of my process.”</p><p>-Tinker Hatfield</p>

This particular “Satin” release evolved into a sequence of drops for the “Royal,” “Shattered Backboard,” and “Black Toe” colorways, making a case for satin editions as some of the most collectible, as a majority of the later “Satin” drops were tailored toward women.</p>

          <p>It’s unlikely that anyone watching Back to the Future Part II in 1989 ever imagined auto-lacing (power laces, as they’re described in the movie) would ever become a reality. Nike designer Tinker Hatfield thought otherwise. The HyperAdapt 1.0 was the first commercially available auto-lacing sneaker, and the very first example of what Nike called their “adaptive lacing” system. Nike Senior Innovator Tiffany Beers explained: “When you step in, your heel will hit a sensor and the system will automatically tighten. Then there are two buttons on the side to tighten and loosen. You can adjust it until it’s perfect.”</p>

          <p>In no way as part of a concerted marketing effort, Vans became arguably the most talked-about footwear brand of 2017-2018. In the wake of the “What are those” meme, the “Damn Daniel” effect turned the Vans Old Skool into the de facto suburban shopping mall shoe. The Damn Daniel meme started as a montage of one high school student filming his friend’s white Vans, and ended up as a JAY-Z lyric: “Damn, Daniel / FBI keep bringing them all white vans through.”<p></p>For a not-so-short while, it seemed like a uniform worn by every single teenager at the mall; a Thrasher hoodie and Vans Old Skools. The trend transcended just middle-America teens though, and even A$AP Rocky had a stint in 2017 where it seemed like he was constantly rocking Old Skools wherever he went.</p>

While further 700 colorways have been introduced since, it’s the very first “Multi Solid Grey” colorway that remains the most cherished by YEEZY fans.</p>

JJJJound – run by Canadian Justin Saunders – applied his keen eye for small goods like hats, tote bags, and mugs into an extremely unassuming collection of sneakers. While the colorways themselves may look like general release Vans, this collaboration truly came to life in the details, such as cork footbeds, heavyweight 8 ounce canvas uppers, and the plain-white shoe box, with a cute JJJJound hang tag.</p>

Adorned with simple gold text reading “CALABASAS” as a nod to the neighborhood enclave outside of Los Angeles which West calls home YEEZY, the Powerphase takes inspiration from early Reebok designs like the timeless Workout and Newport Classic.</p>

        <div class="moment-copy">
          <p>Early in the decade, sneakers like the Common Projects Achilles, adidas Originals Stan Smith, and similar tennis-inspired silhouettes were beloved for their clean lines and versatility. Eventually, these minimal tastes were usurped by a more subversive aesthetic, a shift which arguably started with the overstated Raf Simons x adidas Ozweego.<p></p>At the same time, with the rise of normcore in 2014, we saw the Nike Air Monarch and New Balance 990v4 rise in popularity, alongside anti-beauty silhouettes like the Acne Studios Sofiane and Balenciaga Triple S. Speaking to W, Demna Gvasalia noted: “At Vetements, it’s always very much: ‘It’s ugly, that’s why we like it.”<p></p>Overstated shapes and ironic tastes became the flavor of the month, as sneakerheads started to reject aesthetics that were seen as traditionally appealing. In a development that no one could have predicted, Crocs actually managed to earn a place in the streetwear conversation. Crocs became the epitome of “ironic cool,” as brands like PLEASURES and Balenciaga (um, let’s not forget Post Malone) issued up their own Crocs collabos.</p>

Aspden’s curated Spezial collection of classic adidas low-tops also developed its own following across Europe and even stateside, in a shift that is perhaps linked to the growing awareness of MLS football in North America.</p>

The model made a huge impact thanks to its slim, technical silhouette based on pure research and development. The React Element 87 a was an instant street-style hit when it dropped in Europe during Paris Fashion Week in June. The shoe’s built-in customizability via the option to showcase your socks meant that, with the right sock combo, you could flex the 87 with almost any outfit. Despite the tech, the React Element 87 is still fairly straightforward. None of the individual details distract or detract from the overall design. It’s a sneaker that elicits an almost emotional response, making it difficult to pinpoint the shoe’s exact allure.</p>

          <p>Pioneering retailer Union dropped its own take on the Jordan 1 in 2018, creating a bricolage sneaker design made from OG Jordan 1 colorways. Two versions were made available, with an exclusive Union release made from “Black Toe” and white/grey color schemes, as well as exposed, intentionally imperfect stitching that fuses the two colorways together. A second, globally available colorway was made use of the white/blue with the iconic Black/Red ankle. The collaboration explored what these mismatch colorways could look like, while also nodding towards Union founder Chris Gibbs’ love of vintage markets and vintage Jordans. “The Jordan stuff I wear now is like if I go to a vintage market and I find some really old stuff that’s kind of patinaed or weathered in,” Gibbs noted. “To me, the vintage nature of it allows you to kind of wear it outside of its intended purpose.”</p>

Carbon Digital Light Synthesis technology uses light and oxygen permeable optics to craft a 3D object, and then a thermal baking step to achieve the desired properties. Thanks to Carbon’s innovative process, adidas was able to iterate over 50 different lattices for the midsole before settling on the current design. The creation of the 4D material itself can be simplified by explaining it as the transition from a liquid to a solid as a result of chemical curing, not so dissimilar from how concrete is made. 4D’s “Aero Green” colorway later became a street-level hallmark, via collaborations alongside designer Daniel Arsham as well as retailers Sneakersnstuff and Kith.</p>

          <p>Virgil Abloh’s “The Ten” collection with Nike was by far the biggest sneaker release event of 2017, arguably of the decade. After months of Instagram leaks and anticipation, the collection finally landed at retailers in November 2017, with the Jordan 1 in a “Chicago” colorway considered by many to be the highlight.<p></p>The pack is seminal for a number of reasons, largely because it features a total of 10 reworked sneakers, technically including silhouettes from three brands: Nike, Converse, and Jordan. Utilizing a deconstructed motif across the entire release, Abloh noted to Nike: “The Jordan 1 was done in one design session. I work in a very like dream-like state. I see it, and it’s done.”<p></p>The designer was given unprecedented permission to chop up the iconic silhouette, unstitching the shoe’s top and bottom lace eyelets, delicately pinning Nike’s iconic Swoosh onto the shoe’s upper, and irreverently placing “AIR” branding on the midsole. Abloh’s “AIR” in quotations almost became a brand in and of itself.<p></p>“In one gesture, I wanted to underscore how the design system and manufacturing of Nike are so perfect. […] What we’re talking about here is larger than sneakers, it’s larger than design culture. It’s nothing short of state-of-the-art design. These 10 shoes have broken barriers in performance and style. To me, they are on the same level as a sculpture of David or the Mona Lisa. You can debate it all you want, but they mean something. And that’s what’s important.”<p></p>-Virgil Abloh</p>

Parisian high fashion boutique The Broken Arm was the first to co-sign Salomon, collaborating with the outdoor brand in a move that was seen as unexpected, if not bizarre.<p></p>At the same time, outdoor divisions like adidas Terrex and Nike ACG benefitted from our renewed interest in technical sneakers equipped with Vibram soles and GORE-TEX waterproofing. Other industry-facing names, like Cordura and Polartec, suddenly became buzzwords associated with limited sneaker releases. Function became a quality that was in demand from sneakerheads and collectors.</p>

        <h3 class="hero-shoe-name"><span>sacai x Nike LDWaffle</span></h3>
        <p class="hero-shoe-copy">An updated hybrid of two vintage Nike shoes – the LDV and Waffle Racer – sacai’s clever design was perhaps the most popular collaboration of the year. Debuting in the beginning of 20119 at Paris Fashion Week, the shoe was steeply anticipated until it finally landed in summer. No, you’re not seeing double, the LDWaffle features twice-stacked soles, dual tongues, twin laces, and overlapping Swooshes. The colorways also derive from that same era of Nike design, and you might even recognize one colorway’s green hue as being similar to the signature pantone of Oregon University.</p>

          <p>Following on the success of his Air Force 1 and Air Jordan IV silhouettes, Travis Scott took on the iconic Air Jordan 1, re-imagining the shoe like never before. Electing a brown, white and black colorway, the Scott-edition Jordans feature the addition of a velcro stash pocket, plus the shoe’s most eye-catching detail – an inverted Swoosh. Like his previous Nike collaborations, Cactus Jack branding is found debossed on the heel of the shoe.</p>

          <p>Under-the-radar streetwear brand Cactus Plant Flea Market is the brainchild of Cynthia Lu, who became one of the first-ever female non-athletes to receive her own Nike collaboration when she re-worked the Nike VaporMax sneaker. The irresistibly charming collaboration has a hand-made feel thanks to a re-jigged Nike Swoosh made from garden wiring, plus an offbeat smiley face graphic on the heel. This refreshing and original flip on the VaporMax was widely celebrated, and tough to obtain due to limited availability through Dover Street Market and NikeLab locations.</p>

Abloh’s first sneaker for the French fashion house, the LV 408 Trainer also boasts a hand-written Louis Vuitton signature on the side. According to Abloh, the made-in-Italy LV 408 Trainer takes six hours for each shoe to be stitched. In total, 106 pieces make up the sneaker, while 20 pieces are featured on the sole alone.</p>

          <p>New Balance’s 990 series is surely one of most celebrated sneaker franchises of all time, and the V3 as well as the V4 variations are widely embraced as some of the most timeless, classic shoes on the market. First released in 1982, the brief for the 990v1 called for the best shoe that money could buy, and the original price tag of $100 was seen as quite steep at the time. With that, the debut of the new v5 was surely one of the biggest moments of the year.</p><p>Arriving with a global campaign that cleverly touted the shoe as being worn by “supermodels in London and dads in Ohio,” the perennially cool grey runner is noticeably changed from previous iterations, but familiar enough that many New Balance fans instantly injected this shoe into their rotations.</p>

          <p>Martine Rose played with the proportions of Nike’s Air Monarch to create this divisive collaboration in early 2019. The idea took root after Rose considered how it would be to take a tracksuit fitted for Michael Jordan, and adapt it to her own body. For a size 9 Monarch, Rose then attached a size 18 upper, creating a purposefully disfigured design.</p><p>“We looked at some of the sneaker lasts that Nike have of the athletes and their feet and we applied that to the shoes to create these amazing forms.”</p><p>-Martin Rose</p>

          <p>In April, adidas embarked on a journey toward embracing the concept of a circular economy. The Futurecraft.Loop project ushered in a running shoe that has been designed from scratch to be recycled. As part of phase one, adidas sent out 200 running shoes to beta testers. Once they were well-worn, the brand asked for the shoes to be returned, so they could be ground into TPU pellets and made into components for new shoes. All returned shoes within the Loop program were kept within a closed loop production process – nothing thrown away or wasted.</p>

          <p>Sandy Bodecker was instrumental in the success of Nike’s skateboarding division, acting as the first general manager of Nike SB – in fact, those at Nike who knew him well would joke that SB stood for Sandy Bodecker. Under Bodecker’s leadership, Nike reworked basketball silhouettes like the Dunk and Blazer into skate classics, and laid roots in the skate scene thanks to projects with the likes of Supreme, Antihero, and Zoo York.<p></p>While interest in the Dunk franchise tailed off in the early 2010s, Bodecker’s passing came at a time when Dunks were starting to become a bigger part of the conversation, after the likes of Travis Scott and Virgil Abloh started lacing up pairs of throwback models. Abloh himself even issued up a collaborative Dunk pack featuring original colorways from the “Be True To Your School” series.</p>

          <p>Most CEOs aren’t as public-facing as Mark Parker was. He was hired as a footwear designer and product tester in 1979, by none other than Nike’s first full-time employee, Jeff Johnson. Parker later became CEO in 2006, bringing a design-oriented mindset that set him apart from those who came from a more traditional management background.<p></p>At Nike, Parker equated management with editing, with an openness to creativity, and a focus on innovation. Parker oversaw the design of sneakers like the Pegasus 26+, Air Trainer 1, Presto, and the auto-lacing HyperAdapt, as well as products from the HTM range, which were co-designed by Parker, Hiroshi Fujiwara, and Tinker Hatfield. Parker also folded many artists into the Nike collaborator portfolio, not limited to KAWS, Futura 2000, Stash, Mr Cartoon, and Os Gêmeos, who created limited-edition sneakers in the early 2000s.</p>
